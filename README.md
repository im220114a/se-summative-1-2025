Software Engineering Summative Assignment 1

## Context and Purpose 
Agile Scrum teams rely on daily stand-ups to share progress, address blockers, and plan immediate next steps. Traditionally, a Scrum Master or consistent facilitator leads these quick sessions. However, our managers and Scrum leaders believe in rotating this responsibility amongst each product team memeber. This model is being implemented in order to :
* Foster a culture of shared responsibility and ownership.
* Improve communication skills across all team roles.
* Develop leadership competencies for future Scrum Masters or project leads.
* Encourage more balanced participation, as people who lead one day are more likely to actively support others on subsequent days.

Until now, we’ve been choosing a facilitator informally—often deciding at the last minute. This spontaneous approach can catch team members off guard or unfairly shift the burden onto a few individuals. Our application provides a simple, efficient solution: it generates a random schedule for the entire week, ensuring each person on the product team knows in advance which day they’ll be leading the stand-up. This is achieved by entering the names of each product member into a table in order to generate this schedule In the future, the application could be enhanced to integrate with existing project management tools—such as Jira or Slack—to post daily reminders. However, currently the website produced is a minimum viable product.

## Planning

### Empathy Map
This empathy map was created by analysing the daily experiences of Agile product team members who participate in frequent Scrum stand-ups. I first established who the primary user is (the team member tasked with leading stand-ups) and considered what they typically say, think, do, and feel in a scenario where roles are unclear or randomly assigned at the last minute. By interviewing in office (and through Microsoft Teams) or observing team members—and drawing on my own and the experiences of close colleagues—common themes such as anxiety, uneven rotation, and a desire for advance notice emerged. These insights were then organised into clear categories that reveal unmet needs (“Pains”) and potential benefits (“Gains”).

These findings informed the user stories created for this project.

### User Stories
"As a product team member, I want to enter a list of names so that they appear in on an-screen table, allowing me to visually confirm who is included in the daily stand-up rotation"

"As a product team member, I want to generate a random rota for the week, so that each day has a designated person to lead stand-up"

"As a developer (and indirectly as a product team member), I want an automated testing setup so that I can confidently add and modify features without breaking existing functionality."

Each user story has at least one sub-task associated with it.
